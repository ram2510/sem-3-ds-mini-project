1. We decided to try this project as it satisfied all the requirements of the faculty.
2. We did our research and we concluded and after researchng we concluded that the datatype that suits all are need is trie a.k.a prefix tree. The advantages of trie
   1. Faster than Binary search tree (another data structure we considered for our use case)
   2. More efficient at searching with prefixes then other alternatives
   3. It is already used in many softwares with a mix of natural language processing to increase the accuracy.
   4. Height of the tree is the longest word in the dictonary
3. So now we had to learn various concepts like 
   1. What is trie
   2. Trie ADT
   3. How to read and append data in the file
  

## Approach - 
1. So here is how we approached the project
